# FTA-Calibration-and-Circle-Detection
This is a program that runs a ui that does the following: detect a fiber optic cable and save the x y coordinates.
There are a few things that I have added. one thing is a fully automated process in controlling the DAC values fo the FTA. I have it set to move the fiber tip, take photos, and process the photos though the circle detection function. Some problems I have reached is with the organization of the raw data, as well as the reliability of the circle detection. I have cv2 as my circle detection import, but I am thinking of changing to a centroid detection. I think this might be more relaible and nopt break the automation process as much. Although I think I would be sacrificing the accuracy of the circel centers, they might be off due to the wierd shapes. I dont think they will be off yb more than a few microns so it might be enough to look past who knows.
